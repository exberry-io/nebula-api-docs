# Technical Guidelines

Nebula API protocol is WebSocket (unless mentioned otherwise) \
Any request body should be a valid `JSON`, non valid `JSON` objects will be ignored.

Within the valid `JSON` please be aware that:

* System ignores any additional parameter that was sent on request body but was not specified in this document.
* In case of multiple parameters sent with different values, system will always use the last value provided.

### **Request Parameters**

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| q         | String | qualifier, contains the method for the specific API call.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| sid       | Int    | stream identifier, for each WebSocket connection this is a unique identifier for the API call. Please note that as long as the sid was not ended (other by exchange or by consumer) this canâ€™t be used again on the same WebSocket connection |
| d         | Json   | data object, contain the request body                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

```javascript
{ 
 "q":"exchange.market/placeOrder", 
 "sid":1, 
 "d": 
   { 
     Object
   } 
}
```

### **Success Response**

The response will always include the `q` and `sid` parameters from request and a `d` parameter with the response body.

```javascript
{ 
   "q":"exchange.market/placeOrder", 
   "sid":1, 
   "d": 
     { 
       Object
     } 
}
```

In case of short living stream (i.e. trading action), additional response will be sent upon stream closure with success, this message will include the `q` and `sid` parameters from request and `sig:1`.

```javascript
{
  "sig": 1,
  "q": "exchange.market/createSession",
  "sid": 1
}
```

### **Failure Response**

The response will always include the below parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sig       | signal will be equal to "2"                                                                                |
| q         | from request                                                                                               |
| errorType | internal error type that should be ignored                                                                 |
| sid       | from request                                                                                               |
| d         | <p>data that contain errorCode and errorMessage. <br>Those are the error code and message to consider.</p> |

```javascript
{
  "sig": 2,
  "q": "exchange.market/createSession",
  "errorType": "401",
  "sid": 1,
  "d": {
    "errorCode": 6002,
    "errorMessage": "Missing fields: 'apiKey'"
  }
}
```

### **Stream Closure**

In order to close active stream need to send a message with `sig:3` in addition to `q` and `sid` from request.

```javascript
{
  "sig": 3,
  "q": "exchange.market/orderBookDepth",
  "sid": 100
}
```

sig parameter summary table:

| sig | Description                               |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Stream closed with success                |
| 2   | Stream closed with failure                |
| 3   | Stream was closed due to consumer request |
